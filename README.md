Creating tickets as a User

Here we can see in the User "Open a New Ticket" tab the Help Topics explained during "post-installation configuration" section (https://github.com/RafaBelmonte/osTicket-Post-Installation-Config)



Receiving and Resolving Tickets as an Agent

Here we can see what the "Tickets" tab looks like to an Agent and in the second image, all the information Agents receive when a ticket is sent through the program. (Examples pulled from course Lab)

Ticket priorities can be modified by Agents depending on the severity of the ticket.

Tickets can also be assigned to specific Agents. Some tickets will be escalated to higher levels depending on the impact of the issue.

Tickets can be transferred to different departments depending on User needs and department capabilities.

Under Ticket Threads you can communicate directly with the User and also create internal notes about the particular issue.

When posting a reply, the Agent can also mark the ticket as Resolved, and that will consider it resolved and move it to the "Closed" tab.
